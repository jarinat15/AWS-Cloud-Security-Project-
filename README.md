# AWS-Cloud-Security-Project-
I designed and implemented a custom AWS IAM policy to enforce least-privilege access by restricting EC2 actions based on instance roles. Denied start/stop permissions on the Audit server while allowing them on the Sales server, ensuring secure and role-specific resource control.
●	AWS IAM – users, groups, policies, account alias
●	Amazon EC2 – instance tagging and lifecycle actions
●	JSON policy syntax – Effect, Action, Resource
●	Principle of least privilege and policy testing
